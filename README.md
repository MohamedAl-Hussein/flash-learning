# flash-learning
Proposal: We will build a simple flashcard web app using Flask, aimed at incentivizing children in grades K-8 to remained engaged during remote learning. Students will be able to answer flash card sets by making drawings or typing submissions. Teachers will be able to add new flash card sets to the system and set grade level and subject tags for a particular flashcard set. We are all relatively new in the program without a whole bunch of web development experience, so our primary goal is to work together to have something functional by the end.
